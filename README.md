# Stampus - Coming Soon

Stampus is [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (started as a port) for
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/). The goal is complete
transparency for mixin'd properties and native-feeling convenience classes.

Forked from: [grayrest/stampus](https://github.com/grayrest/stampus)

## Installation
Coming soon. Mean While

You'll have to check that out and `npm link` it in
order to run it.

    cd ~/working/dir/css
    ln -sf ~/path/to/stampus/stampus.styl
    ln -sf ~/path/to/stampus/stampus

At least that's how I've been poking around with it.


## Updates
You can fork and start hacking. I'm planning to maintain this repo until stylus exists.

1. All the features in Compass
2. That's all for now.
